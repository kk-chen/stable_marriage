# Stable Marriage
# This program implements the Gale-Shapley algorithm to solve the stable marriage problem.
# For this particular example, there are an equal number of unwed men and women in King Author's court who need to matched to one another.  However, this algorithm can be applied to various other situations such as the "stable roommates problem" and the "hospital/residents problem".  In any case, there are an equal number of subjects that need to be matched to one another.
